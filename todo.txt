- Maybe change the search results to be ordered by amount of followers someone has and if their friends follows them

- Maybe add a page that shows who you talk to a lot (by count of reply links between them) and this could influence other parts of the site (such as search and reply ordering)

- Look at register, login, logout, follow and post APIs. They're inconsistent. Might move all of them to use the api directory.

- Change delete API to use HTTP delete method

- Stop blocking in profile_get_posts.coffee (instead of flag that stops for all, stop for just active ones through an array)

- Clean up and optimize the suggestion algorithm, make it random


- Change post dates so instead of absolute date, shows relative (e.g. "X minutes ago") and updates on client auomatically
