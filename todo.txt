- Maybe change the search results to be ordered by amount of followers someone has and if their friends follows them
- Maybe add a page that shows who you talk to a lot (by count of reply links between them) and this could influence other parts of the site (such as search and reply ordering)

- Maybe in some cases like getPostsByUsersFollowedBy() write SQL instead of using query sets (for project complexity as it uses nested SELECT statements)

- Add notifications (if a user replies to your post and you're offline/not on a page where you can see it, it'll remember and tell you when you next login)

- On somebody else's user profile, a button to post a message that would say "@person: stuff" but without being a reply
- Private messages? How would these be implemented?
	- Own database table with their own reply table
	- Or same table as posts but with a boolean flag to say private or not

- Fix CSS for the dialogues

- Look at register, login, logout, follow and post APIs. They're inconsistent. Might move all of them to use the api directory.

- Change delete API to use HTTP delete method
